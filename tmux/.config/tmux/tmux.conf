# PLEASE NOTE: most display problems are due to incorrect TERM! Before
# reporting problems make SURE that TERM settings are correct inside and
# outside tmux.
#
# Inside tmux TERM must be "screen", "tmux" or similar (such as "tmux-256color").
# Don't bother reporting problems where it isn't!
#
# Outside, it should match your terminal: particularly, use "rxvt" for rxvt
# and derivatives.
#
# I put it here as a reminder :D.

# Strangely, i didn't set this on Void, but the file icons are shown (i did enable true colors below).
# However on a different machine, they aren't shown, so i put it here.
# Update: somehow on Void, the TERM env is set to "screen-256color" without an explicit setting, weird.

set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Don't use login shell
set -g default-command "$SHELL"

# Enable true colors.
# Probably, i set this in order to be able to use Neovim with termguicolors enabled inside Tmux.
